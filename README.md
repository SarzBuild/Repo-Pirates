# Repo-Pirates
Bathroom Pirates! was a prototype game developed in less than 4 weeks in our 3rd semester programming class at Dawson College. 
The game is a turn-based combat game that works similarly to old J-RPGs such as the 2D Final Fantasy series.

In the bathtub, fierce combat takes place. As the main character of a childâ€™s fantasies, 
the toy pirate ship must conquer all the other toys of the bathtub and declare himself king of the Bubble sea!
